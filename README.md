# zsh-trampoline

zsh + [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) for filesystem navigation.

## What is this?

This is a zsh plugin to facilitate two use cases:

1. `cd` to commonly visited directories.
2. Open in `$EDITOR` commonly visited files.

After sourcing the plugin this keybind is set:

- <kbd>Ctrl-t</kbd> List [configured](#configuration-file) directories and files in fzf.

## Installation

### Without a plugin manager

1. Install [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf).

2. Clone the zsh-git repository by executing the below command:

    ```bash
    git clone 'https://github.com/hernancerm/zsh-trampoline.git' \
      "${HOME}/.zsh-trampoline/zsh-trampoline"
    ```

3. Source the plugin (also add command to your `~/.zshrc` to enable on future sessions):

    ```bash
    source "${HOME}/.zsh-trampoline/zsh-trampoline"
    ```

    OR: If you want to set a custom keybind then use:

    ```bash
    ZT_SET_KEYBINDS=0
    source "${HOME}/.zsh-trampoline/zsh-trampoline"
    bindkey "^t" zt-jump
    ```

    OR: If you use [jeffreytse/zsh-vi-mode](https://github.com/jeffreytse/zsh-vi-mode):

    ```bash
    ZT_SET_KEYBINDS=0
    source "${HOME}/.zsh-trampoline/zsh-trampoline"
    function zvm_after_init {
      zvm_define_widget zt-jump
      zvm_bindkey viins "^t" zt-jump
    }
    ```

### With a plugin manager

With [Sheldon](https://github.com/rossmacarthur/sheldon):

```toml
[plugins.zsh-trampoline]
github = "hernancerm/zsh-trampoline"

# File: ~/.config/sheldon/plugins.toml
```

```bash
# Source plugins.
eval "$(sheldon source)"

# File: ~/.zshrc
```

## Configuration file

zsh-trampoline supports two config files:

1. `~/.zt`
2. `~/.zt.local` (for what you don't want to commit to source control.)

The configs are merged in order, no overrides. I recommend using the first config file for
common dirs/files in your setup, while the second config file for sensitive or
machine-specific dirs/files. Both files share the same syntax.

Example contents of the config file:

```text
~/dev/work
~/dev/temp:0
~/dev/Some Dir With Spaces:0
~/dev/Another Dir With Spaces
${HISTFILE}
$HOME/foo/
```

Explanation of the config file's syntax:

- Each line has the absolute path of one directory or one file.
- By default, directories are expanded to their level-1 sub-dirs.
- Directories may be suffixed with `:0` to list the dir itself instead of its level-1
  sub-dirs.
- Paths containing a colon (`:`) character are not supported.
- The tilde (`~`) character is expanded to the user home directory.
- Environment variables are supported.
